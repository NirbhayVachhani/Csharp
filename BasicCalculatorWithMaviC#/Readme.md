# Basic Calculator App

## Introduction

Welcome to the Basic Calculator App repository! This project is a web-based calculator that enables users to perform elementary arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Designed with simplicity in mind, it provides a user-friendly interface and a responsive design that works on various devices and screen sizes.

The calculator is built using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), a framework for building interactive client-side web UIs with .NET. Instead of using JavaScript, Blazor allows developers to create rich web applications using C#.

## Features

- Perform basic calculations including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- Utilize percentage calculation (%) for quick computations.
- Input decimal points (.) for precise values.
- Reset the current operation with a clear display functionality (C).
